<p>This GitHub public repository ( <b><a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-compatibility">https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-compatibility</a></b> ) was created at the request of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/">OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC</a> as an <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/">OASIS TC Open Repository</a> to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.</p>

<h2><a id="purposeStatement">Statement of Purpose</a></h2>

<p>Statement of Purpose for this OASIS TC Open Repository (openc2-compatibility) as <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/openc2/201802/msg00006.html">proposed</a> and <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/openc2/201803/msg00007.html">approved</a> [<a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/openc2/201803/msg00023.html">bis</a>] by the TC:</p>

<p>The purpose of this public GitHub repository is to capture OpenC2 core design principles and develop implementation guidelines for interoperable systems. <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/"> OpenC2</a> is an evolving standard for computer and network security with continued refinement over language semantics. Development and adoption is hampered by the following "chicken and egg problem": The OpenC2 <!-- forum ? retain? --> community will converge on language and protocols that work well in practice, but implementers need to agree on language and protocols to build interoperable systems.</p>

<p>This repository supports an attempt to bootstrap the process by capturing core design principles and suggesting implementation guidelines. In the short term, it is meant to act as an evolving reference guide to OpenC2 prototype implementers and provide a feedback mechanism to the OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee and its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2#subcommittees">Subcommittees</a>.</p>

<p>This repository work is chartered as an open source effort in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The initial content will be imported from the <a href="https://github.com/jtcbrule/openc2-compatibility">JTC GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>The OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee was <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php">chartered</a> to address matters as they pertain to command and control of cyber defense technologies, and to maintain a library of prototype implementations. The TC charter further specifies that the TC shall provide implementation guidance, as supported by assets in this GitHub reporitory.</p>
